This file is for checking new tool in git. Video no. 3 on playlist, so we are going to see actually tool similar to diff.
Suppose in hundred line of code, Someone make changes like i am going to make here. Then it is hard to find out what exactly changes are made.So good luck here. So nothing just he downloaded a software named "Diff Megre". We just doesn't need this one now, so I am skiping this for later.

Nothing just in video no.3 he also solve merge configt in "Diff Megre" application.
